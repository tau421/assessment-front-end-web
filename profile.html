	<h1 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h1>
		<p>My career goals are very basic at the moment.  After working through Foundations, I should have a better idea of what my future goals will be.  For now, I'd like a job that allows me to support my family while still being able to spend time with them.  That's about it.</p>
